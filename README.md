# multispp_loops
Data and loop tutorial for multi-species multi-site figure production. 
This can then be repurposed for many types of tasks.

This data comes from GBIF.org (27 May 2022) GBIF Occurrence Download
<https://doi.org/10.15468/dl.vf6fgm>. We collected all lupines
(*Lupinus* spp.) in the United States, with coordinate uncertainty less
than \~5000 meters. If you utilize this data elsewhere, please use the
above citation, see [GBIF citation
guidelines](https://www.gbif.org/citation-guidelines).

If you are looking for how to make the same figures or 
run the same analysis on things multiple times, then
this code will help you get started! 

You won't need to look at the data cleaning file at all, 
just get started on the markdown!

If you've never heard of loops before, 
read through the quick loop information section in the markdown.
